## JVM (Java Virtual Machine) Architecture

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine.

It is a specification that provides runtime environment(среда выполнения) in which java bytecode can be executed.

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e. JVM is platform dependent).

## What is JVM

* `A specification` where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified(указана). But implementation provider(поставщик реализации) is independent to choose the algorithm. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies.

* `An implementation` Its implementation is known as JRE (Java Runtime Environment).

* Runtime Instance Whenever you write java command on the command prompt to run the java class, an instance of JVM is created.
