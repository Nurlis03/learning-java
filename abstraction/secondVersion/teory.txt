Abstraction In OOP
In simple terms, abstraction “displays” only the relevant 
attributes of objects and “hides” the unnecessary details.

Abstraction in OOP can be of two types.

#1) Data Abstraction

In data abstraction, we mostly create complex data types and hide their 
implementation. We only expose the operations to manipulate these data types without 
going into the details of their implementation.

One advantage of this approach is that we can change the implementation anytime without 
changing the behavior that is exposed to the user.

#2) Control Abstraction

Control abstraction collects all the control statements that are a part of 
the application and exposes them as a unit. This feature is used when we have to 
perform a working feature using this control unit.

Control abstraction forms the main unit of structured programming and using control 
abstraction we can define simple functions in complex frameworks.
